    <h1>Marina Beach</h1>
    <p>
        Marina Beach is special because it is the longest urban beach in India and the second-longest in the world, 
        stretching along the Bay of Bengal in Chennai. It is a vibrant landmark featuring historical statues, 
        the iconic Marina Lighthouse, an aquarium, and numerous food stalls offering local snacks. 
        While it's a popular spot for strolling, jogging, and people-watching, 
        swimming is prohibited due to strong, dangerous undercurrents.
